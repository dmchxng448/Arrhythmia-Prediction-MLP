# IUBDC 2025: AI-Driven Detection of Early-Stage Arrhythmia

Machine learning model which enforces Python, NumPy, Pandas, Pytorch, and Scikit-learn to predict early-stage arrhythmias **Ventricular Ectopic Beats (VEB) and Supraventricular Ectopic Beats (SVEB)**.

This model was designed for the **2025 Inter-University Health Data and AI Inquiry Program** under the topic:
**_Aging Powerfully: AI Blueprint for Chronic Disease Management and Social Determinants of Longevity_**.

### Model Highlights:
- Determine feature value ranges of select ECG readings for VEB and SVEB detection.
- Predict the existence of arrhythmia given manually entered ECG readings.
- Built on real ECG data from the [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0) - collection of ECG recordings collected from 47 subjects between 1975 and 1979.
- Goal: Enable early monitoring and medication prescriptions before conditions of arrhythmias become detrimental.

### Languages:
- Python
- Excel (data preprocessing)

### Frameworks:
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn

### Data Sources:
- [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (PhysioNet)](https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/)  
  A widely renowned ECG dataset containing records of 47 subjects, collected at Beth Israel Hospital.

- [ECG Arrhythmia Classification Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sadmansakib7/ecg-arrhythmia-classification-dataset)  
  Contributed by Sadman Sakib and his team. Contains ECG features extracted from multiple labeled arrhythmia types.
